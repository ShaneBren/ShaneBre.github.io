Education
======
* B.S. in Environmental Science and Geography, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, expected graduation 2024
   * Geographic Information Science certificate (4.0/4.0 GPA in certificate courses)
   * 3.48 GPA overall

Work experience
======
* Urban Forest Patch Research Fellow June 2023 - August 2023
  * Baltimore Green Space
  * Duties includes:
    * Collected groundcover species coverage, multiple soil metrics, and canopy invasion data to create various heat maps
showing changes in forest patch health over time
    * Creation of standardized forest health patch reports for each site to inform the community and city officials
    * Collaboration with Baltimore Green Space, Baltimore City officials, and both UMBC and US Forest Service scientists

* Assistant Project Manager October 2022 - May 2023
  * University of Maryland, Baltimore County
  * Duties included:
    * Our team collected data on over 7,000 trees: species identification, health assessment, geopositioning, and DBH
    * Data entered and configured for ForestGEO international initiative on long-term forest changes
    * Autonomously investigated long-term successional patterns within Knoll forest patch using ArcGIS Pro

* Laboratory Technician Intern  June 2022 - August 2022
  * Anne Arundel Community College Environmental Center
  * Duties included:                    
    * Collected water samples for bacterial membrane filtration analysis to determine CFUs of enterococcus present 
    * Entered data using Google Earth Pro to post swimming health advisories available to coastal communities
    * Measured water metrics (pH, salinity, etc.) and total suspended solids (TSS) using filtration and analysis

  
Skills
======
* GIS and remote sensing: ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, ENVI, Google Earth Engine, Pro, and Maps
* Field practices: Strong tree identification, groundcover and vine identification, soil measurements (Munsell hue, penetrometer, O/A layer identification, layer depth, and soil texture), and YSI
* Data management and display: R (RStudio), JavaScript, and Microsoft Office programs
* Laboratory practices: TSS filtration, bacterial membrane filtration, CFU analysis, autoclaving, and laboratory safety
* Interpersonal: Troubleshooting as GIS Lab proctor, led ForestGEO data collection shifts, Assistant Manager of the Year (2022) for Burger King franchise, guided training efforts across various classes, surveys, and sampling projects

Projects
======
* Compositional changes of Ash species within UMBC urban forest patch - May 2023
  * Self-led study to observe changes in Ash composition following invasion of Emerald Ash Borer. Configured primary data to join with previous surveys, identifying new growth within basal area of Ash. Results showed that Bitternut Hickory dominated the new growth composition by 21.6%.
	
* Stewardship effects on health of Baltimore urban forest patches - August 2023
  * Presentation to consulting scientists - with UMBC and U.S. Forest Service - and city officials on trends found within Baltimore forest patches. Found correlation between increased stewardship with ecological health indicators such as species diversity, canopy invasion, and native species richness.

* MODIS imagery analysis of glacial area loss relative to changes in latitude - December 2023
  * Google Earth Engine and used to measure glacial area loss within U.S. National Parks corresponding to increases in latitude. Strong results (R2=0.87) indicated increased glacial resistance to global warming at higher latitudes.
