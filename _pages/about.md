I am a student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County expecting to graduate in Spring 2024. I am pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Science and Geography as well as a certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). 

Projects and coursework have focussed on ecology and conservation using GIS and remote sensing as tools to monitor ecological changes. These projects have had a strong emphasis on reproducible and educational research, allowing for greater accessibility.
